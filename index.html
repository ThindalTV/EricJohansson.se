            <p>
                Blazor Blocks is a WYSIWYG block editor for Blazor.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are quite a few "simple" WYSIWYG editors, but I was missing a way of laying out and creating fully responsive pages,
                not just blocks of text and images.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blazor Blocks introduces the concept of a block, which is a self contained type of content rendered,
                which can be placed in columns and rows of your own design. It's a bit like a page builder, but for Blazor.
                Some examples of blocks are normal WYSIWYG editors, images, titles, code, quotes, video links, embeddable content and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The entire project is built with 0 dependencies, which means that while it comes with a default set of row and column
                definitions, it is easy to substitute them for your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the project isn't on Nuget quite yet, you can find <a href="https://github.com/thindaltv/blazorblocks">the source code</a> at GitHub.
                The project is actively taking Pull Requests and contributions.

            <p>
                Deepgram is a speech-to-text service that is easy to use and has a great free tier.
                What they didn't have was a great .NET API; what they had was basically a direct port of their NodeJS API,
                which was not very .NET friendly and didn't follow common design patterns in .NET.
            </p>
            <p>
                Me and a few others have, with Deepgrams blessing, worked on creating a new SDK for using Deepgram from .NET.
            </p>
            <p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk">the official repository</a> at GitHub.</p></div>

            <p>
                It's easy to mess up when streaming, presenting or showing code.
                Lower the risk by hiding your configuration values until you actually decide to show them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This extension hides all values in xml and json files.
                You can click a button to toggle the boxes so you can edit the values,
                but if you close & reopen the file the values are hidden again.
            </p>
            <p>The schema is always visible even when the values are hidden.</p>

            <p>
                Do you have a .NET Framework project out there that's really looking to be updated to dotnet?
                Have a look at the path we chose when upgrading a production web shop running on WebForms with
                every imaginable anti pattern, into a modern framework with a MVC public site and a Blazor administration interface.
                On this trip we will go through subjects like analysis, planning, architecture, some best practices and what will you
                need to do to move it from on premise or Infrastructure As A Service to a fully managed Platform hosted solution.

        <div class="box"><h3>From Chaos to Order - Using the Repository Pattern the Right Way</h3>
            <p>
                If you've ever struggled with your data access being a mess, hard to follow, and even harder to test,
                perhaps using the tried and true Repository pattern might be the right choice for you!
            </p>
            <p>
                In this beginner-friendly and code heavy session, we will break down the principles behind the repository
                pattern and how combining it with other patterns like Unit Of Work will make sure that you keep our data consistent, robust and testable.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, we will dive into some code examples and have a working, basic implementation of a repository
                with the necessary plumbing for your next application.

        <div class="box"><h3>Turning the Dynamic Static</h3>
            <p>
                While it's easy to host dynamic websites with different SPA frameworks and Azure Function calls,
                a static HTML website will often come out ahead when it comes to loading speed and SEO since they are
                smaller and do not require any backend calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using open-source tools and Blazor with the right render mode, you can build a dynamic website hosted
                on your development computer or homelab server. Once the site is built, it can be exported to pure HTML,
                removing the need for dynamic server calls, making the website lightweight and SEO-friendly.
                This combination of Blazor and static HTML provides the best of both worlds: dynamic content during development and fast,
                static pages for the end-user.<br>
                And even keep some dynamic content too!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is how I constructed my personal website supporting daily updates and dynamic content, using minimal dynamic logic.

                Do you like bacon and/or eggs? If that feels like you, then you might like this project.
            </p>
            <p>Learn how to build a .NET tool, how to execute LUA code and how to write a source generator in the tastiest way possible. With bacon!</p>
            <p>
                To use the tool yourself, you can install it from the terminal with
                <code>dotnet tool install -g dotnet-bacon</code></p>
            <p>
                Follow up with running the tool with either <code>dotnet bacon</code> or for some extra tasty,
                use <code>dotnet bacon egg</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it's not obvious, this is a gag project for testing some technology, but it is published and fully working,
