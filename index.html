            Back in 2003, I discovered .NET. Coming from a background of mostly using C++ for client- and PERL/ASP Classic for web-development, finding .NET was like seeing sunshine for the first time.
            Since then, I've been working with .NET in various forms, from ASP.NET WebForms to ASP.NET MVC, from Windows Forms to WPF, from WCF to gRPC, from SQL Server to MongoDB.

            Today, my day job is running a consulting firm specializing in .NET development and Azure architecture.<br />
            At other times, I run an open, inclusive and educational twitch stream helping people experience and learn .NET.

<h3>Blazor Blocks</h3>
<p>
Blazor Blocks is a WYSIWYG block editor for Blazor.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few "simple" WYSIWYG editors, but I was missing a way of laying out and creating fully responsive pages,
not just blocks of text and images.
</p>
<p>
Blazor Blocks introduces the concept of a block, which is a self contained type of content rendered,
which can be placed in columns and rows of your own design. It's a bit like a page builder, but for Blazor.
Some examples of blocks are normal WYSIWYG editors, images, titles, code, quotes, video links, embeddable content and more.
</p>
<p>
The entire project is built with 0 dependencies, which means that while it comes with a default set of row and column
definitions, it is easy to substitute them for your own.
</p>
<p>
While the project isn't on Nuget quite yet, you can find <a href="https://github.com/thindaltv/blazorblocks">the source code</a> at GitHub.
The project is actively taking Pull Requests and contributions.

<h3>Deepgram .NET SDK</h3>
<p>
Deepgram is a speech-to-text service that is easy to use and has a great free tier.
What they didn't have was a great .NET API; what they had was basically a direct port of their NodeJS API,
which was not very .NET friendly and didn't follow common design patterns in .NET.
</p>
<p>
Me and a few others have, with Deepgrams blessing, worked on creating a new SDK for using Deepgram from .NET.
</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk">the official repository</a> at GitHub.</p>

<h3>Don't Doxx Yourself</h3>
<p>
It's easy to mess up when streaming, presenting or showing code.
Lower the risk by hiding your configuration values until you actually decide to show them.
</p>
<p>
This extension hides all values in xml and json files.
You can click a button to toggle the boxes so you can edit the values,
but if you close & reopen the file the values are hidden again.
</p>
<p>The schema is always visible even when the values are hidden.</p>

<h3>The road taken; from Framework to .NETx</h3>
<p>
Do you have a .NET Framework project out there that's really looking to be updated to dotnet?
Have a look at the path we chose when upgrading a production web shop running on WebForms with
every imaginable anti pattern, into a modern framework with a MVC public site and a Blazor administration interface.
On this trip we will go through subjects like analysis, planning, architecture, some best practices and what will you
need to do to move it from on premise or Infrastructure As A Service to a fully managed Platform hosted solution.

<h3>Dotnet Bacon</h3>
<p>
Do you like bacon and/or eggs? If that feels like you, then you might like this project.
</p>
<p>Learn how to build a .NET tool, how to execute LUA code and how to write a source generator in the tastiest way possible. With bacon!</p>
<p>
To use the tool yourself, you can install it from the terminal with
<code>dotnet tool install -g dotnet-bacon</code>
</p>
<p>
Follow up with running the tool with either <code>dotnet bacon</code> or for some extra tasty,
use <code>dotnet bacon egg</code>.
</p>
<p>
If it's not obvious, this is a gag project for testing some technology, but it is published and fully working,
and you can find the <a href="https://github.com/ThindalTV/Dotnet.Bacon">source for dotnet bacon</a> on GitHub.

<h3>Swetugg</h3>
<p>
Swetugg is a conference for .NET developers, by .NET developers. Held twice per year, once in Stockholm
and once in Gothenburg, it reaches hundreds of developers in the Nordics and beyond.
</p>
<p>
For Swetugg, I am a part of the groups responsible for selecting speakers &amp; scheduling, the website and the afterparty.
